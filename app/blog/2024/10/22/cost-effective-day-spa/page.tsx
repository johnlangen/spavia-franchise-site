          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Revenue Diversity</h3>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Even with a lower cost-to-entry for franchisees, Spavia offers
            affordable luxury experiences that do not compromise on quality. Its
            range of services, spanning massages, facials, and body treatments,
            distinguishes Spavia as one of the few day spa franchises with
            multiple revenue streams. In addition to a diverse range of
            treatments, Spavia's three-tiered membership program serves as a
            cornerstone of its revenue model, providing a steady and predictable
            income stream while fostering long-term guest relationships.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Moreover, Spavia's in-spa boutique and online retail offerings
            provide yet another revenue avenue. The boutique serves as a
            convenient destination where guests can shop the very products used
            in their treatments, ensuring they can continue their skincare
            regimen at home with trusted brands. Additionally, it offers a
            perfect solution for guests looking to pick up a thoughtful gift for
            any occasion. This diversity empowers franchisees to generate
            sustainable income while meeting the varied wellness needs of their
            guests and ensuring the financial stability of their day spa
            business.

            selection of their design theme not only enhances the guest

            empowers franchisees, adapts to local markets, differentiates the
            brand, and integrates each location into its community. This
            approach underlines the importance of flexibility and personal touch
            in the franchising model. Additionally, Spavia integrates
