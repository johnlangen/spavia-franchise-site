            How Day Spa Franchisees Are Capitalizing on Health and Wellness in the New Year
          </h1>

          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            As we step into the New Year, there's a collective shift in focus as individuals embrace
            the 'Great Rejuvenation'—a term capturing the heightened awareness of health and wellness.
            With increasing consumer demand for treatments that help to meet well-rounded wellness
            goals, 2024 presents a thrilling opportunity to franchise with a profitable day spa
            concept, like Spavia.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            At the core of the 'Great Rejuvenation,' day spa franchises are positioned as the ideal
            business opportunity for those looking to capitalize on this surge in demand. In the case
            of Spavia, the brand’s meticulously crafted range of memberships and services is designed
            not only to align seamlessly with the evolving focus on health and wellness, but also to
            provide franchisees with a lucrative avenue for meeting and exceeding the wellness
            expectations of their communities.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            In addition to general health and wellness goals, spa gift cards have become a leading
            gift for holidays like Valentine’s Day, with Americans spending a staggering $26B in 2023.
            Nearly a third of gift-givers now prioritize experiences over material items. This trend
            aligns seamlessly with Spavia's offerings, as we provide gift cards that contribute to an
            additional revenue stream for franchisees, complementing our membership-related services.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            In particular, Spavia's commitment to holistic well-being extends beyond traditional spa
            services, creating an immersive experience designed to nurture the mind, body, and soul.
            Potential franchisees are invited to explore the world of franchise opportunities with
            Spavia and embark on a journey where rejuvenation is not just a moment but a thriving and
            sustainable lifestyle. Interested in taking advantage of the growing industry with Spavia,

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">FAQs</h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Do I need experience in the spa industry?</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            While it can’t hurt to have experience in the spa industry, it is not required. We are
            looking for individuals who share our dedication to providing an exceptional experience.
            With our 120 years of spa experience, we can teach you and your team everything you need
            to be successful.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I own multiple Spavia locations?</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Yes, you are able to own multiple locations. Many of our owners have chosen to purchase 3
            or more. We also offer a multi-unit discount.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How much are the royalties and other annual fees?</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Our current initial franchise fee is $49,500. Royalty fee is 6% of gross sales. Marketing
            fee is up to 1% of gross sales.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How long does it take to open a Spavia?</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Each location is different, but the most time-consuming steps tend to be site selection,
            lease negotiation, build-out (including permitting) requirements, and training. We
            anticipate it will take approximately 9–12 months from signing your lease to opening day.
