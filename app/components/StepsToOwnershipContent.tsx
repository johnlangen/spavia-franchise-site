    question: "How much can I make as a Spavia franchise?",
    answer:
      "The federal trade commission and state franchise sales regulations do not allow franchisors to provide profit projections. However, if you become a qualified candidate, we would be happy to share our franchise disclosure document (FDD). The FDD will highlight our historical sales from our franchised locations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need experience in the spa industry?",
    answer:
      "While it can’t hurt to have experience in the spa industry, it is not required. We are looking for individuals who share our dedication to providing an exceptional experience. We can teach you and your team the rest!",
  },
  {
    question: "How much are the royalties and other annual fees?",

  },
  {
    question: "What are the real estate specifications?",
    answer:
      "We prefer for Spavias to be located in shopping centers that have anchor retailers, female oriented retailers, wellness oriented retailers & other national retailers. These types of retailers provide the best synergies (a more comprehensive approach will be available).",
